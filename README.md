# Cataloging system for the EESW challenge.

Software Team Members: Lloyd, Rhys, Elliot, Sid, Harvey, Evie

Ok, so the draft plan we have right now is that we aere going to design a catalogue system with remote databases utilising the company's servers that we assume they have. These databases will be accessed via handheld PDAs that scan unique barcodes assigned to each of the 500 pallets. These pallets are to  be designed by the harware team. 

Currently we have:

**Rhys B** => research cataloging systems

**Elliot** => What other companies use for cataloging system
                     |
                     V
**Siddharth** =>  _________________

**Harvey** => QR codes durability/how to place.

**Lloyd** => What rhys is doing

**Evie** => Research Barcodes and how they apply to our situation.

All code/notes will be stored here for everyone to access, currently the only contributors are me and Rhys, if anyone wants to add their code you can submit a pull request and I'll merge it.

First off we need to decide on the system we're going to use before we start to make anything. Everyone has their role as far as I know.
